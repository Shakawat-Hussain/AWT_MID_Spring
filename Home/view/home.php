<textarea id="motivation" width="1440" rows="10" cols="190"> As a human being we make judgments every single day about the sort of things we say,think and do and inclined to let other
know but there are also kind of things we don’t want anyone else to know about. A common human nature where people
seeks a place to be free and avoid other people’s judgmental eyes. This concept of privacy is not limited to our living life
but virtually as well. People in general would think they don’t value their privacy unless they are involved in some terrorist
organization or some criminal or illegal activities. But their actions negate the authenticity of that thought. One day while
using a classmate’s computer I have noticed there are alcohol product ads everywhere almost in every website that is
visited. It’s a matter of wonder why these ads are displayed in his computer where I have never encountered such things
before in other devices. After a little research online I figured out how websites tracks our online interests and show ads
based on user’s behavioral activity without considering if the products or items are legal or not according to user’s region,
how this addiction could significantly affect the human nature of that user. From the incident of that day I had a feeling this
problem needed fixing and worth working on it .In my perspective human shame is a powerful motivator that helps to
maintain discipline in cultural,religious and moral ethical field and it is only possible if the user knows that they are in a
state of being tracked and watched by some other third parties so their behave and decisions they make online while
browsing will be affected significantly. A large number of people will disagree but also realize it is important to limit
online marketting advertisement to maintain a morally social environment and to protect our childrens from harmful
desires. This research aims to bind all positive things together and avoid unhealthy effect of companies thirsty online
marketting. This research study is just a small step I’m taking to fulfill a larger spectrum of internet privacy and
consumer rights." size="180"</textarea>
